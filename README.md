## FAQ

#### Is there a premium version of the bot

As of when I am writing this, no. Currently there is no premium version of the bot but I do intend to make one.

#### How do I host the bot myself?

As of now I have not created a guide on self installation

#### How do I make suggestions for the bot?

To make suggestions you can use the `z!suggest` command followed by your suggestion

#### I want to use this bot for a roleplay type not in the bot currently, what do I do?

I am welcome to suggestions for more roleplay types and I am happy to implement them. If you want to have a chat with me you can DM me and we can talk about a new roleplay type.
